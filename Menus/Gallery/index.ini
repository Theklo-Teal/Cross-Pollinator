title="Seibra Gamma Clothed Portrait"
descr="Seibra Gamma 988 is an elite exoskeleton pilot and also Exfon's girlfriend. Originally a male soldier operating in what is now Ireland, but 18036 years ago, when a combat accident forced her to be transported to Agartha to evade death. Her hairstyle and lack of the left eyebrow is a reminder of the part of her face that was obliterated during this decise incident."

title="Basic Agarthian Soldier Uniform"
descr="In here, Nova Zeta 19001 demonstrates the base attire of Agarthian soldiers. Depending on mission and specialty, other layers are worn over this basic uniform. It can holster the Zatarc pistol, which is a fully automatic, self-aiming gun, which fires rounds made of AGM, so the magazine at the lower receiver and the barrel that swivels don't need to be mechanically connected."

title="Coat of Arms of Agartha"
descr="The flag and coat of arms of Agartha. It was designed to be reminiscent of Art-Deco patterns, but it is said to represent the hands of two life partners holding up a giant diamond."

title="How to Identify an Agarthian Poster"
descr="Hypothetical propaganda poster that would be used by governments in search of disguised Agarthians. It is a bit bigotted and rather slanderous."

[grt_script.png]
title="Agarthian Script guide for English speakers."
descr="A guide for the writing system used by Agarthians. It was developed well within Agartha after it was established, so although the culture is ancient, the writing is pretty modern. Most Agarthians are born already knowing how to read, write and speak."
