"Deep Underground Military Bunkers" refers to the extensive and secret network of tunnels connecting secret facilities and military bases. Railroads laid through tunnels within deep bedrock connect several facilities and enable undercover activity to be untraceable.

These tunnels are usually deeper than [[Symposium]] underground facilities, but [[Agarthians]] have a suspicion that they exist, although unable to find them.

Originally Bunkers capable of resisting nuclear war, that were connected to metropolitan railways, sewage and between nuclear silos. Later some bunkers were expanded to function as testing ranges and hangars for secret weapons. Eventually most military bases included underground research facilities which were used to store Agarthian technology and sometimes experiment on it. Eventually there were attempts there to replicate Agarthian technology.

Fighting underground restricts a lot of modern and sci-fi technology that would solve conflicts easily. It's dark, firearms produce too much smoke and noise. Explosives can't be too big or will collapse tunnels. Satellite technology is unusable.

From a gameplay standpoint, it allows linear and constrained level design to be plausible. Some areas could be flooded so the player's abilities and strategies have to change.

LIGO is 4Km wide.
LHC is 8.6Km wide.
Maybe the DUMB radiates from a similar facility.
