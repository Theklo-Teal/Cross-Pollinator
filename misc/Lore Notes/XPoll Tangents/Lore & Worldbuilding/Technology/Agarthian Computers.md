Organic Neurons and Photonics are used together to make computers which are incompatible with Danavo technology. They were invented much earlier than Danavo's.

In an attempt to make devices that translate orgone into electronics and back, slices with networks of artificially grown neurons were invented. The amount of connections to interface with these neurons also makes electronic wiring unpractical, so neurons enhanced to sense [[Orgone|ectoplasm]] are also modified to be luminescent and light sensitive, emitting addressable signals that are received by optotransistors and also responding to light pulses in an optics fiber cable.

As Mind-Machine Interfaces became a solved problem, this technology was further developed to construct computers out of biological neurons. They usually look like bundles of microscopic tubes lined in neuron networks. Spinal fluid is pumped through the tubes to supply the neurons and also acts as the optical substrate of a optics fiber data bus. This data bus has purposeful structural defects that act like amplifiers, mirrors and splitters which act like encoders and decoders, allowing for further processing at a quantum level. Regular electronics is then used for peripheral control and interfacing between machines.

Rainbow Mainframes are composed of racks of Agarthian computers. Smaller units are also at the core of many Agarthian devices, at least as translators of Agarthian thought into machine commands. Manufacturing Agarthian computers is one of the most demanding tasks of Molecular Synthesizers.
