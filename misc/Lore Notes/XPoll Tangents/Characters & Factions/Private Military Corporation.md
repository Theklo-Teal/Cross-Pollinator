Some organizations do very important things involving a lot of wealth, likely in very clandestine circumstances, but don't have the resources to train and upkeep their own infantry, so instead hire private security agents for the guarding and defense.

Agarthians often hire PMCs when they don't want to risk capture or revealing their existence or capabilities in combat. Even thought they train their own soldiers, these are much smaller in numbers and less expendable than a Danavo mercenary.

Sometimes governments will also hire PMCs to augment their troops with special weapons and tactics. So you'll always find a PMC agent mixed in with any faction.
