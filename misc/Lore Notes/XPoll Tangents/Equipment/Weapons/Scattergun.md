Agarthian version of a semi-auto shotgun. What Agarthians use when they need a powerful firearm. It has an unusual feeding system with very high capacity. The ergonomics are dubious, as it was originally meant to be operated by robotics.

It fires caseless telescoping cartridges containing three parallel bullets with slight speed delays as they run down the barrel, effectively acting as a burst for each trigger pull, a technique known as "hyper-burst". These bullets diverge slightly, increasing the chance of hitting a target without aiming carefully, or if the target is fast moving.

The projectiles expand violently on contact, enabling the destruction of cover and armor without penetrating.
