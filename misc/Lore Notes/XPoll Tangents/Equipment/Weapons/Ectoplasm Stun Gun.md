A weapon optimized to defeat Agarthians. It shoots frozen pellets of Ectoplasm programmed to overwhelm the ectoplasm sensing abilities in Agarthians and their technology, disabling them.

It can be set as an ice-thrower, where the ectoplasm pellet causes sudden cooling where it hits and freezes the targets.
