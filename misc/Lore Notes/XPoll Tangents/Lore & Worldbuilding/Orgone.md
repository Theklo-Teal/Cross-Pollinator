There is a field around the Earth that is unknown to common humans and is named "**Noosphere**". Its discovery is what distinguishes [[Agarthians]] and propelled them to become much more advanced. It is similar to the magnetic field of the Earth, but doesn't interact through electromagnetic forces and instead it's an accumulation information produced by living beings with their minds and as they counteract entropy.

Much like photons are a disturbance in a magnetic field, Orgone is a disturbance in the Noosphere and usually present as a flow in active mental processes. Human neurons have a latent ability to condense orgone into a physical substance called "**Ectoplasm**", which has some strange properties like being highly ectothermic and temporarily storing thoughts and emotions. Ectoplasm can vary in texture and consistency depending on its concentration, ranging from a fog to be as hard as plasticine, but often is stored as a thick slippery translucent liquid.

Agarthians were prompted to swiftly develop genetic engineering with the goal of enhancing the ectoplasm producing abilities of neurons and invent technology around this substance.

When Agarthian Technology was unearthed by common humans, secret projects were initiated to try replicate ectoplasm powered devices, but without the context of understanding the Noosphere, these efforts have had low yield.

The most important development from this knowledge are the [[Rainbow Mainframes]] which enable Agarthians to have their minds uploaded and unbound by physical limitations.
