From Agarthian: "Variable Curvature", could be read as "curving bullets"

It is a full automatic firing pistol on a gimbal that can aim itself, based on identified targets near the users center of attention.

It uses liquid propellant in a combustion chamber that pushes the barrel out like a piston when firing. The gases are contained behind the barrel in the piston chamber after it has fired. This allows the pistol to have no muzzle blast and be silent.

It feeds from a belt of bullets drawn from the waist pockets of a soldier, and fires automatically. It doesn't have cartridges to eject and instead of a bolt, the chamber is open when the barrel blows forward. It doesn't have a lot of terminal effect, but allows soldiers to make impossible shots and hit targets reliability while moving or around corners.

When not in use, the gimbal retracts and the weapon is stowed under the soldier's forearm. The auto-aim function of this weapon doesn't work without an Agarthian Combat vest, but can still be fired in the stowed position.
