A facade name for the [[Agarthians]] as they operate above ground. They pretend to be a unremarkable administrative NGO. Holding multiple facilities in the form of office blocks, warehouses and mansions across the world, wherever Agarthians need to keep people away from accidentally stumbling upon their [[Sanctum]].
It is also in some of these facilities where they are trained to do their jobs and engage in surreptitious activity.
New Agarthians are born or manufactured in these facilities before getting transmigrated to Agartha. See [[Life Cycle]]
