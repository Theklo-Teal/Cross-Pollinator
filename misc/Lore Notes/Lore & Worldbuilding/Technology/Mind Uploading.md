Agarthian Name: Homa Transmigrigado (Human Transmigration)
---
The logical conclusion of mind-machine interfaces was the ability to record the state of a brain with large bandwidth. Quickly came the realization that people could be emulated within computers, free of the limitations of physical bodies. This is called [[Life Cycle|Transmigration]] and upkeeping the resulting [[Life Cycle|Devio]] became the reason of being for Agarthians wishing to join in.

In practice, the state of the human brain is not simulated in Rainbow Mainframes, but rather, their [[Orgone]] patterns in the Noosphere are sustained by interacting with it like biological brains do. There is, therefore a continuity of existence of the transmigrated minds, rather than duplication.
