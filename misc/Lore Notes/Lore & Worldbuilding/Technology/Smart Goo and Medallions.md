Warehouse Alias: Ink and Inkwell
Agarthian Name: Spritilo (Smart Tool) and Medaliono

The Agarthian version of "Programmable Matter" or "Utility Fog".
What appears to be a viscous fluid is actually a colloid of nano-machines that can be electronically controlled. They are capable of rearranging to any shape and although not physically strong, they are useful as fluid pumps by forming into narrow tubes with peristaltic motions.

They require continuous contact with adjacent Smart Goo particles up to a control device, or are unable to receive commands. Often Agarthians will wear Smart Goo as a body suit, where their Medallion translates their thoughts into the electronic commands. When not deployed, the Goo is stored within the medallions.

Smart Goo is capable of powering itself through photovoltaic effect. In good conditions can even generate surplus energy that powers other portable devices. It also has some metamaterial properties, like being able to change color due structural coloration.

As a versatile technology Agarthians enjoy having it always equipped, even if not deployed for disguise purposes. Some of its common uses include:
1. Active thermal regulation by pumping fluids around the body.
2. Health monitoring
3. Linking with electronic devices which don't have mental control interfaces
4. Visual signalling, enabling communication without making sound
5. Using surplus photovoltaic production to assist other devices.
6. Pumping and projecting [[Silk Shot|Silk]]
7. Camouflage, including radar stealth

The formula for Smart Goo can be adjusted to optimize different uses. It can be made to be more rigid like in [[Seigro's Invention]] or as armor.
