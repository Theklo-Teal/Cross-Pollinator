Agarthian Name: Ektoplasma Frida-Uzino (Ectoplasm Cold Mill)

It is known that [[Orgone|Ectoplasm]] spontaneously draws surrounding heat as it dissipates. Agarthians have harnessed this property to run heat engines in reverse, thus producing electricity. [[Rainbow Mainframes]] require large amounts of power, so drawing from Danavo sources would leave suspicious traces. [[Sanctum|Sancta]] always have four generators on the ceiling. These generators are too large for any portable application, so usually Smart Goo is used as a power source instead.

The Ectoplasm used as fuel in these generators is usually provided by the activity of Rainbow Mainframes, but small black-start devices can stimulate volunteering Agarthians to produce enough "slime" to harvest for a short time.
