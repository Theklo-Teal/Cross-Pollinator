Warehouse Alias: Keycard
Agarthian Name: Memorilo
---
A seemingly inert ampule containing stable ectoplasm. It stores computer information and Agarthians can even [[Contact Telepathy|lick it]] to reproduce emotions or memories between individuals that were recorded like a photograph.

[[The Warehouse]] started naming them "Keycard" after realizing that some vials could be used to unlock doors or start up exotic devices, as if they were authentication or decryption devices.
