In Agarthian: Sankteio
The special room of [[Lore & Worldbuilding/Agarthians/Architecture|Agarthian Architecture ]] that's hidden under [[Symposium]] facilities. In this room, [[Artifact Ideas|Agarthian Technology]] is manufactured and everything related to [[Rainbow Mainframes]] is operated. 

At the center is the Personality Core, also known as the "Dream Cell".  A rising platform that looks like an altar and lifts a person into sensorial immersion chamber, or virtual reality room. Similar to the Star Trek "Holodeck". In here it's possible to communicate with [[Life Cycle | Devio]]. It is also here that transmigration is performed. The body is suspended by sonic levitation and disassembled while the brain is scanned and recorded into Rainbow Mainframes.

The staircase leading to the altar sits on top of a Rainbow Mainframe. A series of pipes carry and store [[Orgone|ectoplasm]] produced during the operation of the Mainframe up the walls of the room. They act as the transceiver antennae linking the Mainframe to the Noosphere network. The resulting ectoplasm is carried to an electrical generator on top of the Personality Core where it is used up as fuel and cooling fluid.

Along the walls there are a series of large artificial wombs capable of producing human bodies as well as organic artifacts. Here there are also molecular synthesizers and medical equipment.
