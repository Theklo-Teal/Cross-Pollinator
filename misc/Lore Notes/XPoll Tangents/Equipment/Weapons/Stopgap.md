Agarthian Alias: Kimero
---

A Danavo pump shotgun which has been adapted in the field to fire Agarthian design self-propelled missiles similar to the [[Guided Darts]]. But instead of being guided, they can airburst at selected ranges, even after penetrating cover.

It has two magazine tubes, allowing to alternate between two types of ammunition: Fragmentation, effective against Danavo armor, and Incendiary for destroying cover.
