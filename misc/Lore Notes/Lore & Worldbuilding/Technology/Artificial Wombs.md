Agarthians rely on large artificial wombs to [[Life Cycle|reproduce]] These grow any correctly programmed embryo either into a new human body, but also organic devices, without human involvement. This is called "Ectogenesis". Although Agarthians can't reproduce themselves, their own wombs can also be used to produce technology in the same way if necessary.

When producing a new Agarthian member, the embryo is synthesized in the Molecular Synthesizer according to instructions and design from the Council of Agartha. New Agarthians are produced by their order in reflection of the needs to fulfill jobs.
