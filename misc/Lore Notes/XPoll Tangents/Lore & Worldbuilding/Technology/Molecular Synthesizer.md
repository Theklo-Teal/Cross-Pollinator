These small machines produce various organic substances at an atomic level, usually for medicine. Through these, viruses can be programmed for gene therapy and Smart Goo is manufactured.
It's composed of a transparent vial connected to various amino acid containers through a spindle made of Smart Goo. The Goo acts like a programmable catalyst or enzyme, assembling proteins arbitrarily. Multiple spindle nozzles allow high production rates by repeating the same operations in parallel.

A special lamp rotates around the vial to act as an optical tweezers, and for tomography assemblies, allowing products to be mechanically rearranged and non-organic parts integrated in the product. Agarthian computers are made in this way.
