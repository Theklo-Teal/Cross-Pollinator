Agarthians often learn to speak one or two Danavo languages, like English, but they have a native language that is genetically programmed. The Agarthian language is very analytical and has simple syntax without grammatical exceptions. It is derived from early European languages, as Agarthians originated in Europe. This language is a dialect of Esperanto. In lore, the Esperanto we know was created by Agarthians as an attempt of soft power to shape Danavo culture to theirs.

It is common for Agarthians to have an accent when speaking Danavo languages, as well as making small malapropisms where they construct a sentence like they would in their native language, for example by omitting article words or using the feminine pronouns as universal to any gender.

For a long time in their history they've appropriated Greek letters as numbers in their language, but gradually have adopted Hindu-Arabic numerals, reserving Greek notation for formal situations. The number "3" can often be written as "γ" and pronounced "gammo" for cardinals or "gamma" for ordinals, although in the new convention the spelling "tri" for cardinals and "tria" for ordinals is dominating.

Much as in Esperanto, all nouns end in the letter "o", and so do all person names. Danavo names will be adapted accordingly, sometimes replacing an ending vowel, like "Filipa" becoming "Filipo", other times by appending like "Adam" becoming "Adamo", whichever articulates better into regular syllables and doesn't interfere with other language expectations.

They also have their own writing system, used when writing in Agarthian language, but can easily take foreign words if necessary. It is a alphabet of consonants assembled into single symbol syllables with diacritics indicating vowels, much like an Abugida. In formal texts it is written as lines alternating up-down and down-up, then stacking lines from right to left, but often just right-left, from top to bottom is used, or vertical lines for short sentences.

Depending on in-group culture within Agarthians, there are also tongue clicks, which streamline common simple messages like "yes" or "good". These vary according to the group, distinguishing them like a shibboleth. The [[Agarthians|Council of Agartha]] recommends three clicks to be consistent and be taught to Danavo allies.
