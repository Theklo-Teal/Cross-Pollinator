In Agarthian: "Agartho", often shorthanded to "GRT" or "GRTh" depending on [[Language|transliteration]].
The virtual world that's rendered by [[Rainbow Mainframes]] and allows physical simulation and interaction of the entity that's a merging of all [[Life Cycle|Devio]] consciousnesses. It is possible to communicate with Agartha by entering a [[Sanctum|Personality Core]] and this is how Agarthians are managed and governed. The Devio operate as Agartha's government, so maintaining and defending Mainframes is the reason-d'etre of [[Life Cycle|Adityo]].

Entering Agartha is deemed very desirable in Agarthian culture, but being unable to "quit" or return to a material body has been a major limitation, as it disables Devio from functioning in the material world.

The experience in Agartha is very dream-like, being possible to materialise objects and locations without any obvious technology. The world changes around a person in conformity to their intentions and mood. Still a lot of functions are represented diagetically to maintain alignment between the mental habits and the material world.

It isn't known to Agarthians, but each Rainbow Mainframe integrates the actual brain of one of the founder member of Agartha and that's why building more Mainframes is not possible. Their spinal cord is what enables the Mainframe to connect to the transceiver arrays and interact with the Noosphere. Each transmigrated Agarthian becomes integrated in the mind of the founder at the place they were scanned, combining their personalities and knowledge. This limits a lot the kind of person that can be transmigrated as it must not cause dissonance with the established minds.

Adityo erroneously believe that after transmigrating they will live as independent people with autonomy, but in reality they are basically "preserved" until technology to diverge the minds and reincarnate becomes possible. A problem the founders have focused hard at directing Adityo to solve.

The merged mind entities of the founding members are who speak through the Personality Cores and they are regarded as the governing authority known as the "Council of Agartha". Their names are thought to be codenames and they are suspected to have been the scientists who originally developed Mind-Uploading. The known councilmember names include:
- Geo, affectionally nicknamed "Pa-ka"
- Ponto
- Urano
- Krono
- Reao

The [[The Warehouse]] alias for the Council of Agartha or their members is "Majestic 12".
