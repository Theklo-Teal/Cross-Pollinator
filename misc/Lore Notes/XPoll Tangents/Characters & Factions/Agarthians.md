![[Agartha_Coat_of_Arms_Embossed.png]]

A crypto-terrestrial culture of highly advanced humans. It functions similarly to a cult. Upon inventing [[Artifact Ideas|Mind Uploading]] they have been retreating into isolation. The virtual reality where they inhabit is named [[Agartha]]. Those not in Agartha are designated [[Life Cycle| "Adityo"]] and work to maintain and defend the [[Rainbow Mainframes]] hidden underground that sustain Agartha in the hopes of one day joining as well.

Above ground, they administrate a facade organization named "[[Symposium]]", allowing them to operate among Danavo in disguise. The mention of "Agartha" is secret and replaced by "Symposium" in conversations. The selected Devio within Agartha acts as the leaders directing Adityo and managing their activities.

Whenever a Danavo are found to be investigating or having witnessed Agarthian activity, Agarthians perform psycological operations (psy-ops) to mislead, harass and suppress them. This is the source of "Men in Black" stories. Agarthians sometimes trick people to believe that any [[Artifact Ideas]] they witness is actually from space aliens, resulting the growing UFO hoax phenomenon through history.

Although a very reserved and chauvinistic society, their sporadic alliance with Danavo on some jobs has earned enough honor in some of them to be allowed [[Life Cycle|transmigration]]. Agarthians do careful vetting and training before engaging with allies to ensure compatibility with this process.

Generally they make use of Danavo clothing, architecture and weapons to stay in disguise while operating above ground. But they have an internal culture with things derived from their exotic technology. Agarthian attire is used whenever working in the [[Sanctum]] and Agarthian weapons are brought up when a conflict situation becomes overpowering.

Their entire society is composed of genderless sterile humans with female appearance, despite generally expressing as androgynous. Their genetics is greatly simplified and they lack sex chromosomes, but their wombs can be induced to produce small [[Artifact Ideas|organic machines]]. They also possess special neurons which senses [[Orgone]] and secrete ectoplasm more efficiently, enabling them [[Contact Telepathy]].

See about their [[Life Cycle]] 

Agarthian names are composed of a common name like "Theklo" and a greek letter distinguishing from the people born in the same year with the same name, like "Alpha". Then a number tells the year of birth since the first transmigration to Agartha.

So "Theklo Alpha 250" was born in the year 250 and was the first person named "Theklo" in that year. The name can be alternatively written like "**Theklo α βε'**". All their names end with the letter "o" as a quirk of their [[Language|native language]].
