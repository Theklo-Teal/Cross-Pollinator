## Themes:
- Vitalism + Biopunk
- Men In Black
- Hideo Kojima Secret Organizations
- Super-competent military coordination
- Underground Combat

## Setpieces:
- Philadelphia Experiment
- Alien Interview
- Carl Sagan's Contact (Decoding the Voyager Record)

## Guidelines:
1. Who is your protagonist?
2. Who or what opposes them (antagonist, obstacle, force)?
3. What is the main conflict or problem?
4. What is the story’s main event or goal?
5. Why does the character want what they want?
6. Why should the audience care?
7. What’s the setting and how does it shape the story?
8. How does the protagonist change/grow by the end?

1. [[Ethan Lennox]], [[Seigro Gamma]], other 2 characters more.
2. "Agarthian Investigators", [[The Warehouse]]?
3. Find an Agarthian base and delivering Seigro. Disabling secret labs along the way.
4. Inventing the [[Bioprinters]]
5. Seigro, as other Agarthians seek to maintain secrecy about their existence
6. I don't know. Hopefully the characters will have enough charm for people to do rule34 on them.
7. Modern day military underground tunnel networks. Tunnels connect to secret labs where things must be activated/deactivated to learn more about Agarthians and increase the team's capabilities, but hostile soldiers stand in the way,
8. Ethan becomes an Agarthian ally, available for new adventures/missions from them, and has sex with Seigro. Seigro learns to respect Danavo.


During the Second World War a German V-bomb fell through a building in London as a dud. This was one of the early deployments of the secret weapon and the government rushed to border off the building and try to retrieve the wonder weapon for analysis. The building belonged to an NGO called "[[Symposium]]" and inside they found the bomb having penetrated an unexpected number of floor deep underground, then sitting in the middle of a strange chamber with exotic technology. Interest in the V-bomb shifted to understanding this strange collection of technology in the middle of the rubble.

Samples of the artifacts encountered, were shipped to the USA for their own analysis, but  half of these shipments were diverted by unknown actors. It is possible that all major superpowers of the world are now secretly aware that some entity is producing highly advanced and incomprehensible technology. It is suspected that they are racing to successfully replicate [[Artifact Ideas]] first.

The [[DUMB]] at the game's setting is being used to carry out the "Cross Pollinator" Program, under supervision of [[The Warehouse]]. With a network of X-Labs, they are trying to understand and replicate Agarthian technology. A lot of knowledge about Agarthian activity has also been collected.

There is a diversion being employed to make believe that "X-Poll" is the invention of a teleportation device.

[[Agarthians]] aren't very excited about being investigated and potentially having their [[Orgone]] network interfered with, so they often run sabotage operations against any research or laboratory involved in this technology.

## Idea 1
Despite multiple Agarthians being successfully evacuated from the London bombing, and preserving their secret existence, [[Seigro Gamma]] was in the middle of incubation (see [[Life Cycle]]) and was born in the hands of the [[The Warehouse]]. She was interrogated, tested and held captive, as the only known Agarthian member in the world.
Agarthians anonymously hire [[Ethan Lennox]] to rescue Seigro.

## Idea 2
As [[The Warehouse]] managed to run their first experiments in the Noosphere, it became possible for Agarthians to locate the lost London artifacts. They hire [[Ethan Lennox]] to join with [[Seigro Gamma]] who is able to enter the [[DUMB]] so they may retrieve the artifacts. Of course, they find the network is covered in labs investigating Agartha, so they have to sabotage  them all.

## Idea 3
A scientist or engineer suspects of Agarthian activity in a particular underground facility and comes to [[Ethan Lennox]] to ask for a guide team to investigate. There they find out the facility connects to the [[DUMB]] and there's a lot more to see. They stumble upon [[Seigro Gamma]] being captive, eventually.

## Idea 4
Believing there's a teleportation device being constructed, the player has to collect information about which lab this is happening in. Certain labs will have references to other labs doing research on components of the teleporter, so collecting intel from one lab leads to others for the next mission. Some of these components mention the requirement of Anti-Gravity Material, which allows to manipulate gravity waves. This is of the outmost interest to Agarthians.

## Idea 5
A scientist from the X-Poll program, but with limited knowledge about it, defects after figuring out Agartha's existence. He then informs them of X-Poll program, so they hire [[Ethan Lennox]] to team up with [[Seigro Gamma]] to investigate and sabotage the labs.
