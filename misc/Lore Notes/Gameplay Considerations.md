Tunnels connect secret facilities where Agarthian Technology is being collected or investigated.

In most of them you fight Danavo guards. It could be Warehouse soldiers or PMC in small labs.

Some facilities are derelict Agarthian buildings and these will be defended by Agarthian soldiers. These act as "boss battle" arenas. Seigro is not concerned about fighting them because she knows these soldiers can't be killed and maintaining cover of their mission is more important.

The Facilities, after combat, might have documents to search, about the nature of Agartha, or large exotic devices like experimental Noosphere transceivers to disable like a puzzle game. Regardless, they always have ammunition and equipment upgrades the protagonists accumulate and use in future combat. Maybe there isn't central hub headquarters, but rather any facility that was defeated become occupied and available for free travel?

Somehow I want to shoehorn in a sort of "alien contact message" puzzle that must be decoded. Maybe an overarching puzzle that unlocks a map of the tunnels or alternate operations for the exotic lab devices. Could this message be brought up by a scientist-type character, which goes on to search the tunnels seeking the source of the message, then joins Ethan? Could the whole mission/plot be started by the message-holder who needs help traversing the tunnels?

Maybe one of the early discoveries in the story is a "[[Sanctum|Dream Cell]]" prototype. This would be  used like a combat simulator, so an hub, where players can select and repeat combat missions.

There could be a mechanic about laying wire along several facilities that enables phone and radio communication. Areas with comms enabled can be fast-traveled to.
