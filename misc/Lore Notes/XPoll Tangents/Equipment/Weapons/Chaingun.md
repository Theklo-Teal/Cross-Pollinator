Not based on anything real. Fires small and under-powered cartridges with high speed bullets.

A belt-fed machine gun intended for suppressive fire and deterrence. Doesn't need to be very accurate or powerful, just needs to keep shooting for a long time.

It includes a constant recoil mechanism, where instead of jerking impulses with each shot, the weapon spreads out the force across the whole firing cycle, making it feel like a constant push on the shoulder.
