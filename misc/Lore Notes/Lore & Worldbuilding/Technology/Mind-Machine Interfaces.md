Agarthian Name: Kiso (Kissing)

[[Contact Telepathy]] is often performed between people, but it was originally developed as a way to control technology. Able to produce ectoplasm carrying their intentions, machines respond as extensions of Agarthian's bodies without the need for levers or keyboards. Likewise, Agarthians can read ectoplasm from their machines and receive pictures, sound and sensations which are perceived like recalling a memory, so screen displays and electronics speakers are rare in Agarthian devices.
