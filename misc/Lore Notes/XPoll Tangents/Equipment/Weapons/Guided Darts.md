An special munition deployed by some Agarthian uniforms. It is small like a large caliber bullet, but capable self-propulsion and guidance. It can fly at high speed and for half a minute before running out of fuel. It is often fired in salvos which circle around and penetrate the target multiple times before returning to the user for refuelling. It takes the niche of grenades in Agarthian military.
