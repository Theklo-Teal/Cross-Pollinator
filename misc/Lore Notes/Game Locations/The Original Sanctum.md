This is where a prototype of the [[Sanctum|Personality Core]] can be found. It serves as a fake out for the anticipation of meeting the Agarthians and Seigro joining them. There's no [[Rainbow Mainframes]] and power has been provided from the occupation by the [[The Warehouse]].

The place was long abandoned and dilapidated when Warehouse discovered it.
