## Fragmentation
Standard explosive spreading shrapnel in all directions. Destroys adjacent cover and kills anything within an area.
## Smoke
Creates an area where nor vision nor most night-vision will work, enabling friendlies to change position without enemies registering the move.
## Flash
Causes sensorial over-stimulation of soldiers, blinding and deafening them temporarily. They will move erratically and might enter panic. Specially effective to enemies using Night Vision Goggles.
## Incendiary
An hyperbaric device that will make anything catch fire or melt, destroying cover and causing lingering damage to soldiers.
## Anesthetic
Based on Agarthian biotech, an odorless gas from a stealthy release of this grenade will eventually knock out soldiers in an area without killing them.
## Stimulant
Based on the drugs supplied by the armor of Agarthian soldiers, a gas is released that increases focus and metabolism of friendly soldiers. It will make them more susceptible to panic, though.
