#Player_Char #Agarthian #Chevron 
An Agarthian soldier that joins Chevron to act as Agarthian technology specialist. Although not trained as an engineer, she's the only one who can activate and operate Agarthian designed devices.

She has tattoos with Agarthian writing spiralling around the forearm. One arm says "Keeps Coming", the other says "Coming Upon". She also has the standard Agarthian military tattoo.

She fancies herself as a philosopher warrior. Her determination in upholding the interests of Agartha comes from believing to be the sacrifice to the "gods" of violence that ensures the others she loves don't have to experience it.

During combat, she is harsh and a ruthlessly efficient machine. Unphased by any chaos or pain, but whenever finding a moment of peace, she becomes laid back and chill, providing serenity and solace to those around.
