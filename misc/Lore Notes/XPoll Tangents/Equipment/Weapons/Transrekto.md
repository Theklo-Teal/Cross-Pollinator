From Agarthian: "Straight Across"

A canister of singlet oxygen attached to a gun stock with adjustable optical system. It can be triggered to generate a high power laser and take down single point targets stealthily.

The computer integrated in Agarthian Combat Vest can swing a mirror and prism, automatically adjusting for the movement of a target withing the field of view of the telescope sight.

It can fire 3 short pulses before being depleted. Usually shooting one round at a time for sniping purposes, but would be capable of firing a long beam with the power of all three pulses in one go if necessary.

This weapon can't be reloaded or recharged. The chemical laser fuel must be replaced to use again.
