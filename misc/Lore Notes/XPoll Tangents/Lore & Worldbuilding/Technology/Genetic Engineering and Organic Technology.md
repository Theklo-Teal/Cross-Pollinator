It isn't possible to interact with [[Orgone]] without biological neurons, or electronics alone, so a lot of effort was put by Agarthians into understanding how to manipulate biology and grow synthetic neurons with enhanced Ectoplasm producing and sensing abilities. These were used to translate Orgone into electronic signals a machine can use, but once they tried genetically manipulating human bodies to have these enhanced neurons, they discovered it was possible to communicate telepathically.

Other body alterations followed, methodically streamlining the human genetics, simplifying physiology and correcting what they deemed inconvenient. The Agarthian genome contains only 10 chromosomes and they have eliminated sexual dimorphism. Several organs were removed and others modified to perform multiple functions.

At the same time they experimented creating machines with the same mechanisms of biological life, effectively breeding novel living organisms to use as utilities.

Agarthians are absent of genetic diseases and for other ailments they usually fix with gene therapy. They also have have regenerative devices and will often prefer amputation and re-growth over enduring discomfort of a healing limb.
