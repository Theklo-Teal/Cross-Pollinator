[[Agarthians]] are produced by ectogenesis from artificial wombs in [[Sanctum|Sancta]]. They are artificially designed so their bodies are improved over natural humans as well as being optimized for the jobs they will be trained on.

These Agarthians are kept under incubation under an accelerated growth factor for 6 years, but having developed equivalent to be equivalent to 20 years of a natural human. They can live for about 200 years with minimal senescence thanks to their genetic engineering, but usually they transmigrate much earlier.

"Transmigration" is when a human is mind-uploaded using [[Rainbow Mainframes]], effectively enabling them to access [[Agartha]]. They have a effectively immortal existence in Agartha, waiting to become "incarnated" again, once [[Bioprinters]] are invented. Agarthians with physical bodies are called **Adityo**, where those that have moved to Agartha are called **Devio**. The slang "transported" is often used by Agarthians, referring to either incarnating or transmigrating. They are granted transmigration after achieving recognition in their job and retiring.
